- [ ] "Add Your First" button works when no subscriptions exist
- [ ] Subscription form loads correctly
- [ ] Form validation works
- [ ] Successful submission closes modal and refreshes list
- [ ] Loading state shows during submission

### 4. Edit Subscription Functionality
- [ ] Edit button on subscription card opens edit modal
- [ ] Form is pre-populated with existing subscription data
- [ ] Changes can be saved successfully
- [ ] Modal closes after successful edit
- [ ] List updates with new data

### 5. Delete Subscription Functionality

- [ ] Delete button removes subscription and closes modal
- [ ] List updates after deletion

### 6. Navigation
- [ ] Back button works correctly
- [ ] Navigation from tab parameter works
- [ ] URL routing functions properly

### 7. State Management
- [ ] UI state persists correctly during operations
- [ ] Modal states work properly
- [ ] Loading states are accurate
- [ ] Error handling works as expected

### 8. Performance
- [ ] Page loads quickly
- [ ] Mutations are responsive
- [ ] Cache invalidation works (data stays fresh)
- [ ] No unnecessary re-renders

## Technical Verification

### React Query Integration
```typescript
// Verify these hooks are working:
const { data: subscriptions, isLoading, isError, error } = useSubscriptions(user?.id);
const addMutation = useAddSubscription();
const updateMutation = useUpdateSubscription();
const deleteMutation = useDeleteSubscription();
```

### Zustand Store Integration
```typescript
// Verify these store actions work:
const {
  isSubscriptionModalOpen,
  editingSubscriptionData,
  openEditSubscriptionModal,
  closeEditSubscriptionModal,
  openDeleteSubscriptionModal,
  closeDeleteSubscriptionModal,
} = useAppStore();
```

### Cache Invalidation
- [ ] Adding subscription invalidates subscription and dashboard queries
- [ ] Updating subscription invalidates subscription and dashboard queries  
- [ ] Deleting subscription invalidates subscription and dashboard queries

## Expected Behavior

### Loading States
1. **Initial Load**: Shows `SubscriptionPageSkeleton`
2. **Mutations**: Shows loading indicators on buttons
3. **Empty State**: Shows "No subscriptions" message with add button

### Error States
1. **Network Error**: Shows error message with retry option
2. **Validation Error**: Shows form validation messages
3. **Mutation Error**: Shows error feedback to user

### Success States
1. **Add Success**: Modal closes, list refreshes, new subscription appears
2. **Edit Success**: Modal closes, list refreshes, changes are visible
3. **Delete Success**: Modal closes, subscription removed from list

## Common Issues to Check

### Type Safety
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] Proper type checking in IDE
- [ ] Correct prop types passed to components

### Data Flow
- [ ] Subscription data flows correctly from query to UI
- [ ] Form data submits with correct structure
- [ ] Mutations receive proper parameters

### UI Consistency
- [ ] Loading states are consistent across operations
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Modal behavior is consistent

## Performance Considerations

### React Query Optimizations
- [ ] Queries use appropriate stale time (5 minutes)
- [ ] Cache time is set correctly (10 minutes)
- [ ] Retry logic works with exponential backoff

### Zustand Optimizations
- [ ] Store updates are minimal and targeted
- [ ] No unnecessary re-renders from store changes
- [ ] Store state is properly reset when needed

## Browser Testing

### Desktop
- [ ] Chrome
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari
- [ ] Edge

### Mobile
- [ ] iOS Safari
- [ ] Android Chrome
- [ ] Responsive design works correctly

## Accessibility

- [ ] Keyboard navigation works
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Proper ARIA labels
- [ ] Focus management in modals

## Next Steps

After verifying the subscriptions page works correctly:

1. **Move to SubscriptionView Component**: Modernize `components/subscriptions/SubscriptionsView.tsx`
2. **Integration Testing**: Test interaction between page and component
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Verify complete subscription workflow
4. **Performance Testing**: Measure and optimize if needed

## Success Criteria

The subscriptions page modernization is successful when:

✅ All manual tests pass
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ Performance is equal or better than before
✅ User experience is smooth and responsive
✅ Code follows established modernization patterns
✅ Cache invalidation works correctly
✅ Error handling is robust
