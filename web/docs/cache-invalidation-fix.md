# Cache Invalidation Fix for TransactionsView

## Problem Identified

The TransactionsView component was not automatically updating after transaction mutations (add/edit/delete) due to incorrect cache invalidation in the React Query mutation hooks.

### Root Cause

The mutation hooks in `useTransactionsQuery.ts` were invalidating `queryKeys.transactionsList()` but the TransactionsView component uses `useTransactionsPaginated()` which has a different query key (`queryKeys.transactionsPaginated()`).

**Before Fix:**
```typescript
// Mutations were only invalidating this:
queryClient.invalidateQueries({
  queryKey: queryKeys.transactionsList(variables.userId), // ['transactions', 'list', userId, filters]
});

// But TransactionsView uses this query:
useTransactionsPaginated() // Uses ['transactions', 'paginated', userId, filters]
```

This meant that when transactions were added, updated, or deleted, the paginated query cache was not invalidated, so the UI didn't refresh.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Mutation Cache Invalidation

Changed all transaction mutation hooks to use `invalidationKeys.allTransactions()` instead of specific query keys:

**After Fix:**
```typescript
// Now invalidates ALL transaction queries:
queryClient.invalidateQueries({
  queryKey: invalidationKeys.allTransactions(), // ['transactions'] - matches all transaction queries
});
```

This invalidates all queries that start with `['transactions']`, including:
- `['transactions', 'list', userId, filters]` (transactionsList)
- `['transactions', 'paginated', userId, filters]` (transactionsPaginated)
- `['transactions', 'detail', transactionId]` (transactionsDetail)
- `['transactions', 'search', userId, query]` (transactionsSearch)

### 2. Enhanced Query Keys Structure

Updated `lib/queryKeys.ts` to include paginated queries in user-specific invalidation:

```typescript
userSpecific: (userId: string) => [
  queryKeys.dashboardSummary(),
  queryKeys.transactionsList(userId),
  queryKeys.transactionsPaginated(userId), // Added this
  queryKeys.subscriptionsList(userId),
],
```

### 3. Added Debug Logging

Added console logging to mutation success handlers to help verify cache invalidation is working:

```typescript
onSuccess: (data, variables) => {
  console.log('Transaction added successfully, invalidating caches...');
  // ... invalidation logic
  console.log('Cache invalidation completed for transaction addition');
},
```

## Files Modified

1. **`hooks/queries/useTransactionsQuery.ts`**
   - Updated `useAddTransaction()` mutation
   - Updated `useUpdateTransaction()` mutation  
   - Updated `useDeleteTransaction()` mutation
   - Added debug logging

2. **`lib/queryKeys.ts`**
   - Enhanced `userSpecific` invalidation to include paginated queries

## Testing the Fix

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Add Transaction Test:**
   - Go to TransactionsView
   - Add a new transaction via the FAB button
   - Verify the transaction appears immediately in the list
   - Check console for invalidation logs

2. **Edit Transaction Test:**
   - Click edit on an existing transaction
   - Modify the transaction details
   - Save changes
   - Verify the updated transaction appears immediately
   - Check console for invalidation logs

3. **Delete Transaction Test:**
   - Delete a transaction (if delete functionality exists)
   - Verify the transaction disappears immediately
   - Check console for invalidation logs

### Expected Behavior

- ✅ Transactions list updates immediately after any mutation
- ✅ No manual refresh required
- ✅ Dashboard also updates (due to dashboard cache invalidation)
- ✅ Console shows invalidation logs
- ✅ Smooth user experience with reactive updates

### Console Output Expected

```
Transaction added successfully, invalidating caches...
Cache invalidation completed for transaction addition
```

## Comparison with Working DashboardView

The DashboardView works correctly because:

1. **Dashboard mutations properly invalidate dashboard queries:**
   ```typescript
   queryClient.invalidateQueries({
     queryKey: invalidationKeys.allDashboard(), // Invalidates all dashboard queries
   });
   ```

2. **Transaction mutations also invalidate dashboard queries:**
   ```typescript
   // This was already working correctly
   queryClient.invalidateQueries({
     queryKey: invalidationKeys.allDashboard(),
   });
   ```

The fix brings TransactionsView to the same level of cache invalidation consistency.

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Immediate UI Updates:** Transactions appear/update/disappear instantly
2. **Better UX:** No need for manual refresh or page reload
3. **Consistent Behavior:** Matches DashboardView behavior
4. **Future-Proof:** Works with any new transaction query types
5. **Debugging:** Console logs help verify functionality

## Prevention for Future

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Always use `invalidationKeys.allX()` for mutations** instead of specific query keys
2. **Test cache invalidation** when adding new query types
3. **Use consistent patterns** across all mutation hooks
4. **Add debug logging** during development to verify invalidation

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the fix can be easily rolled back by reverting to the previous specific query key invalidation:

```typescript
// Rollback to this if needed:
queryClient.invalidateQueries({
  queryKey: queryKeys.transactionsList(variables.userId),
});
```

However, this would bring back the original bug.

## Conclusion

This fix resolves the cache invalidation issue and ensures that TransactionsView behaves reactively, providing immediate feedback to users when they perform transaction operations. The solution is robust, future-proof, and follows React Query best practices.
