# Progress Log

## 2025-04-11

- Supabase project for veeda-wallet was created manually by the user.
  - **Project ID:** vuyswmhrxccwlhunzrdf
  - MCP-based project creation was attempted, but failed due to an internal error in the Supabase MCP server ("crypto is not defined" during cost confirmation). User proceeded with manual creation.

- Created `transactions` table in Supabase (Project ID: vuyswmhrxccwlhunzrdf) via MCP with multi-user support:
  - Columns: id (uuid, PK), amount (integer), category (text), note (text), date (timestamptz), user_id (uuid, FK to auth.users)
  - Row Level Security (RLS) enabled: users can only access their own transactions.
  - Policy: `user_id = auth.uid()`

- Integrated Supabase Auth UI for authentication:
  - Installed: @supabase/supabase-js, @supabase/auth-ui-react, @supabase/auth-ui-shared
  - Created `lib/supabaseClient.ts` to initialize the Supabase client.
  - Created `app/auth/page.tsx` to provide a login/signup UI using Supabase Auth UI.

- Added authentication state management:
  - Created `hooks/useUser.ts` to provide user/session context and listen for Supabase auth state changes.
  - Integrated `UserProvider` in `app/layout.tsx` to make authentication state available throughout the app.

- Fixed TypeScript/JSX errors in the authentication state hook:
  - Renamed `hooks/useUser.ts` to `hooks/useUser.tsx` to support JSX syntax.
  - Corrected Supabase auth subscription cleanup logic to use the correct subscription object.
  - The hook now compiles and works as intended.

- Enforced authentication for main app page:
  - Created `components/ProtectedLayout.tsx` to redirect unauthenticated users to `/auth`.
  - Wrapped `app/page.tsx` with `ProtectedLayout` so only logged-in users can access the dashboard.

- Improved login/signup page:
  - Replaced default Supabase Auth UI with a custom shadcn-styled `AuthForm` in `components/AuthForm.tsx`.
  - Updated `app/auth/page.tsx` to render the new AuthForm for a modern, branded authentication experience.
