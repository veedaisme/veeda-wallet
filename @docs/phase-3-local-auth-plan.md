# Phase 3: Secure Local Authentication Implementation Plan

## Objective

Prioritize robust local authentication (biometric/device-level security) to ensure all customer data is securely stored and accessible only to the device owner. Postpone full login/logout and transaction count tracking until after local auth is complete.

---

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### 1. Research & Select Packages

- Use [`local_auth`](https://pub.dev/packages/local_auth) for biometric and device-level authentication (Face ID, Touch ID, fingerprint, device PIN).
- Use [`flutter_secure_storage`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_secure_storage) for encrypted storage of sensitive data (credentials, session flags, encryption keys).
- Ensure both packages are added to `pubspec.yaml`.

### 2. Platform Configuration

- **iOS:**
  - Update `Info.plist` with required permissions for biometrics and device authentication.
  - Ensure device passcode is enabled for fallback.
- **Android:**
  - Update `AndroidManifest.xml` with required permissions.
  - Handle device credential fallback (PIN, pattern, password).

### 3. Implement Local Authentication Service

- Create a service in `lib/core/storage/` (e.g., `local_auth_service.dart`) to encapsulate all local authentication logic.
- Expose methods for:
  - Checking device support for biometrics/device auth.
  - Prompting user for authentication.
  - Handling fallback to device credentials if biometrics unavailable.
- Use Riverpod/get_it to provide the service app-wide.

### 4. Secure Data Storage

- Store all sensitive data (e.g., Isar encryption key, session flags) using `flutter_secure_storage`.
- Never store sensitive data in plain text or in app memory longer than necessary.
- Use unique keys per user/session if possible.

### 5. Authentication Flow Integration

- On app launch, require successful local authentication before decrypting or accessing any user data.
- If authentication fails or is canceled, keep the app locked and show a secure lock screen.
- Allow re-authentication on demand (e.g., after timeout, backgrounding, or sensitive actions).

### 6. UI/UX Considerations

- Provide clear, user-friendly prompts for authentication.
- Indicate when biometrics are unavailable and fallback to device credentials.
- Allow users to opt-in/out of biometrics if desired (with fallback always required).
- Handle errors gracefully (e.g., too many failed attempts, device not supported).

### 7. Testing & Validation

- Test on real devices for all supported platforms (iOS/Android).
- Validate fallback flows and error handling.
- Ensure no sensitive data is accessible without authentication.

## Best Practices & Security Considerations

- **Never** store sensitive data unencrypted.
- Use platform-provided secure storage APIs.
- Minimize the time sensitive data is kept in memory.
- Always provide a fallback to device credentials if biometrics are unavailable.
- Do not rely solely on biometricsâ€”combine with device-level security.
- Regularly review and update dependencies for security patches.
- Clearly communicate privacy and security to users.
